# Question 1
> This code is an old part of the computer system management library responsible for file indexing. 

> It works but there are number of problems with it.

- Firstly please comment on the existing code pointing out as many issues/bugs as you can find.

- Secondly rewrite the code using OO principles. 

> Any C++ libraries can be used. Proposed solution should resolve inherent bugs and maintainability issues but also be more extensible and efficient.  

> For example: instead of indexing only one directory at a time, we might want it to index subdirectories as well.

> It is an open problem so the solution does not have to be complete but it has to demonstrate a clean and easy to maintain coding style and an understanding of effective coding techniques.
